I realised I was doing the same thing over and over when starting a new build so decided to create my own mini bootstrap which has the basics for starting a simple static web site:

* Responsive layout
* LESS and Sass stylesheet support - you choose
* Styleguide 
* Progessively enhanced javascript carousel
* Progessively enhanced javascript tabs
* Progessively enhanced javascript hide show
* Example XML Sitemap
