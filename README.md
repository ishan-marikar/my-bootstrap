About
-----

I realised I was doing the smae thing over and over when starting a new build so decided (whilst I had the time) to create my own mini bootstrap which has the basics for starting a new site including:

* Responsive layout
* Less stylesheets
* Styleguide 
* Progessively enhanced javascript carousel
* Progessively enhanced javascript tabs
* Example XML Sitemap
